This repo contains the files for the GoFundTerps web application. This web application allows users to make donations to fundraisers happening at the University of Maryland. The html folder contains the html pages, the css folder contains the css files that affect the design of the pages, and the php folder contains the php files, which allows us to take user input and interact with the database (storing and retrieving information). Users can register, login, find fundraisers happening on campus, start their own fundraiser and donate to any fundraiser of their choosing through Paypal payment.
