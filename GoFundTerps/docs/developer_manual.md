File Structure:

	-We decided to keep all our files organized in their corresponding formats. For example you will find all the html files in the html folder, all the css files in the css folder, all the php files in the php folder, all the SQL files in the sql folder, and all the images in the images folder.

Software/Libraries:
	-To continue to improve this app, you will need to install a text editor to your system. You will also need to install Apache, MySQL, PHP, jQuery, and AMPPS. GitHub is also recommended for ease of updating files. To run this application you need an account on AWS to run the application on the server and maintain it.

System Environment:
	-You can download the files and continue to test/improve them on your own personal system and localhost. However, the app will be live on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) server.

Database Structure:
	-Our database is in MySQL. Our database is composed of tables for user's registration/login information, a table for fundraisers, and a table for organizations.
